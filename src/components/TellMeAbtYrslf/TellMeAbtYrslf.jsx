      <h3>Hi, I'm Tye! I'm a Software Developer. My pronouns are they/them.</h3>
      <p>
        After graduating from General Assembly and receiving my certificate of completion, I moved to Pittsburgh to find new opportunities. I moved in with my best friend from high school. She is a successful young woman of Puerto Rican heritage- just like me- who had just graduated from Carnegie Melon and was getting ready to start her first remote job in tech. She is a wonderful role model for me as I walk down my own path into the tech industry. Right now, I'm working as a Sales Associates at Spencer's Gifts, applying to jobs, polishing off old projects, and developing new ones! You can find me showing them off to my developer friends at Pittsburgh Meetups like Code and Coffee and Code for Pittsburgh. I'm working on the exciting idea of deepening my skills through certifications and a degree.

        My favorite technology is React front-end framework (Postman is pretty cool, too). Iâ€™ve also experimented with different backend technologues, for example Express along with Python paired with Flask.
